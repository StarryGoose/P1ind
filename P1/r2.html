    <h2>Preface</h2>
    <p>Hi there! Alot's been going on and even more's been on my mind lately.
      so apologies if this is a bit more low-effort than was expected
    </p>
    <h2>Preparation</h2>

    <P>Unfortunately, I smooshed them too wide, so I had to put them one by one in the airfryer. I set it up to 180
      degrees for 15min,make sure to check on them and flip them every so often</P>

    <P>It's nice and cozy out</P>

    <P>I used what I had laying around for these burgers, so some buns and some goat cheese (naturally lactose free, fun
      fact)</P>

    <p>And there we have it, a lazy meal for a cozy day</p>
    <h2>Thoughts</h2>
    <p>The patties were really nice and crispy from being in the airfryer,
      the cheese melted nicely.
      Great meal for a not-so-great day
